## Classical Mechanics


### Newtonâ€™s laws (just as intuition).

### Oscillators & waves (mass-spring, pendulum, wave equation).


Central forces (Kepler problem â†’ conservation laws).

Lagrangian mechanics (principle of least action, generalized coordinates, Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations).

Hamiltonian mechanics (phase space, canonical transformations, Poisson brackets).

Noetherâ€™s theorem (symmetries â†’ conservation laws).

ðŸ“Œ Math needed: Calculus (differentiation, integration, series), ODEs, vector calculus, linear algebra.

2. Classical Electromagnetism (minimal but crucial)

You donâ€™t need circuits, but you do need fields. This is the seed of quantum field theory.

Maxwellâ€™s equations (differential form, vector calculus).

Wave equation & electromagnetic waves (light as EM wave).

Gauge symmetry (vector/scalar potential, gauge transformations).

Energy & momentum in fields (Poynting vector, stress tensor).

ðŸ“Œ Math needed: Vector calculus (divergence, curl, Laplacian), PDEs, Fourier analysis.

3. Classical Wave Theory

This is the bridge to quantum mechanics.

Harmonic oscillator (already in mechanics, but emphasized).

Superposition & Fourier analysis (modes, wave packets).

Normal modes of coupled systems (matrices, eigenvalues).

Continuous systems (string, membrane, wave equation).

4. Statistical Mechanics / Thermodynamics (lean version)

This part feels boring to many, but itâ€™s the language of ensembles, entropy, and quantum many-body physics.

Laws of thermodynamics (just principles, no Carnot engine details).

Microstates & macrostates (statistical ensembles).

Boltzmann distribution & partition function.

Entropy as information measure.

Fluctuations & thermodynamic limit.

ðŸ“Œ Math needed: Probability, combinatorics, logarithms, some calculus of variations.

5. Classical Field Theory (gateway to QFT & GR)

Where mechanics + E&M generalize.

Lagrangian density for fields (Kleinâ€“Gordon, Maxwell).

Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations for fields.

Energy-momentum tensor.

Lorentz invariance in classical fields.
