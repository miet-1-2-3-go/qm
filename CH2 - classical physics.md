## Classical Mechanics

Classical mechanics is the **branch of physics that studies the motion of macroscopic objects and the forces that affect them,** primarily **using Newton's laws of motion.** It **describes how objects move under the influence of forces and predicts their future and past states with accuracy for everyday phenomena.** Classical mechanics is an approximation that breaks down at very small scales (quantum mechanics) and at speeds approaching the speed of light (relativistic mechanics).
**Key Concepts**
* Newton's Laws of Motion: The **foundation of classical mechanics, these laws describe the relationship between an object's motion and the forces acting upon it.**
* Force: An **influence that can cause an object to change its velocity.** 
* Motion: **The change in an object's position over time.**
* Determinism: If you know the **current state of an object and the forces acting on it, you can predict its future and past motions using classical mechanics.**
**Applications and Limits**
* Applicability: Classical mechanics **accurately describes the motion of everyday objects, from projectiles to celestial bodies like planets and galaxies.** 
* Limits: It is not suitable for phenomena at extremely small scales (subatomic particles) or at very high speeds close to the speed of light, where quantum mechanics and relativity are required. 
**Example** 
**Predicting the trajectory of a baseball or the orbit of a planet are classic examples of problems solved by classical mechanics.**
In essence, classical mechanics provides a powerful framework for understanding the physical world at human scales, but it is essential to recognize its limitations when dealing with the very small or the very fast.

### Newtonâ€™s laws
Newton's Three Laws of Motion describe the **relationship between an object's motion and the forces acting on it:**

* **First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia):** **An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force.**
  Statement: An object maintains its state of rest or constant velocity unless a net external force acts upon it.
* Concept: Objects tend to maintain their current state of motion. If something is still, it will remain still, and if it's moving, it will continue moving at a constant speed and in a constant direction unless a force interferes.
Example: A book on a table will stay there unless someone pushes it or another force acts on it.


* **Second Law of Motion (Law of Acceleration):**
Statement: **An object's acceleration is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass, acting in the same direction as the force.**(an object's acceleration is proportional to its net force ex: u pushing an object directly affects the acceleration of an object  meancwhile its acceleration is inversely proportional to its mass, the higher the mass the weaker the acceleration depending on the force)
  The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (F=ma).
  Example: **Pushing an empty cart is easier than a full one because the less massive cart accelerates more quickly with the same force.**
Playing baseball: When a baseball player hits a ball with a bat, the **bat applies a force to the ball, causing it to accelerate. The harder the player hits the ball (more force), the greater the acceleration, and the farther the ball travels.**
Catching a ball: A baseball player catching a ball instinctively moves their hand backward. By increasing the time it takes to stop the ball's momentum, they reduce the force exerted on their hand (\(F=\Delta p/\Delta t\)).
1. "Acceleration is directly proportional to the net force"
What this means: The more force you use, the more an object will accelerate.
In other words: If you push something harder, it will speed up faster.
Analogy: Imagine pushing a shopping cart. If you push it gently, it moves slowly. If you give it a hard shove, it speeds up quickly. 
2. "Acceleration is inversely proportional to its mass" (the higher the mass the weaker the force thats what inversely means)
What this means: The more mass an object has, the harder it is to accelerate. Or, with the same force, a heavier object will accelerate less than a lighter one.
In other words: For the same amount of effort, a lighter object speeds up more than a heavier one.
Analogy: Imagine pushing two shopping carts with the same amount of effort. One is empty, and one is full of groceries. The empty cart accelerates much more easily and quickly than the full one, which resists the change in motion because of its greater mass.

* **Third Law of Motion (Law of Action-Reaction):**
* **For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.** Forces occur in pairs, so if object A exerts a force on object B, B exerts an equal and opposite force on A.
Important point: These forces act on different objects and do not cancel out.
Example: **A rocket pushes gas down (action), and the gas pushes the rocket up (reaction). When walking, your feet push backward on the ground (action), and the ground pushes forward on your feet (reaction).**
Swimming: **A swimmer pushes the water backward with their arms and legs (action). The water, in turn, pushes the swimmer forward with an equal and opposite force (reaction).**
A rocket launch: A rocket's engine expels hot gases downward at high velocity (action). The expelled gases push the rocket upward with an equal and opposite force, known as thrust (reaction).
Jumping off a boat: When you jump from a small boat to a dock (action), the **boat moves away from the dock (reaction).** This is because your **force on the boat causes the boat to exert an equal and opposite force on you, propelling you forward.**
