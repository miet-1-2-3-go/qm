## Classical Mechanics

Classical mechanics is the **branch of physics that studies the motion of macroscopic objects and the forces that affect them,** primarily **using Newton's laws of motion.** It **describes how objects move under the influence of forces and predicts their future and past states with accuracy for everyday phenomena.** Classical mechanics is an approximation that breaks down at very small scales (quantum mechanics) and at speeds approaching the speed of light (relativistic mechanics).
**Key Concepts**
* Newton's Laws of Motion: The **foundation of classical mechanics, these laws describe the relationship between an object's motion and the forces acting upon it.**
* Force: An **influence that can cause an object to change its velocity.** 
* Motion: The change in an object's position over time. 
* Determinism: If you know the current state of an object and the forces acting on it, you can predict its future and past motions using classical mechanics. 
**Applications and Limits**
* Applicability: Classical mechanics accurately describes the motion of everyday objects, from projectiles to celestial bodies like planets and galaxies. 
* Limits: It is not suitable for phenomena at extremely small scales (subatomic particles) or at very high speeds close to the speed of light, where quantum mechanics and relativity are required. 
**Example** 
Predicting the trajectory of a baseball or the orbit of a planet are classic examples of problems solved by classical mechanics.
In essence, classical mechanics provides a powerful framework for understanding the physical world at human scales, but it is essential to recognize its limitations when dealing with the very small or the very fast. 

### Newtonâ€™s laws (just as intuition).

### Oscillators & waves (mass-spring, pendulum, wave equation).

Central forces (Kepler problem â†’ conservation laws).

Lagrangian mechanics (principle of least action, generalized coordinates, Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations).

Hamiltonian mechanics (phase space, canonical transformations, Poisson brackets).

Noetherâ€™s theorem (symmetries â†’ conservation laws).

ðŸ“Œ Math needed: Calculus (differentiation, integration, series), ODEs, vector calculus, linear algebra.

2. Classical Electromagnetism (minimal but crucial)

You donâ€™t need circuits, but you do need fields. This is the seed of quantum field theory.

Maxwellâ€™s equations (differential form, vector calculus).

Wave equation & electromagnetic waves (light as EM wave).

Gauge symmetry (vector/scalar potential, gauge transformations).

Energy & momentum in fields (Poynting vector, stress tensor).

ðŸ“Œ Math needed: Vector calculus (divergence, curl, Laplacian), PDEs, Fourier analysis.

3. Classical Wave Theory

This is the bridge to quantum mechanics.

Harmonic oscillator (already in mechanics, but emphasized).

Superposition & Fourier analysis (modes, wave packets).

Normal modes of coupled systems (matrices, eigenvalues).

Continuous systems (string, membrane, wave equation).

4. Statistical Mechanics / Thermodynamics (lean version)

This part feels boring to many, but itâ€™s the language of ensembles, entropy, and quantum many-body physics.

Laws of thermodynamics (just principles, no Carnot engine details).

Microstates & macrostates (statistical ensembles).

Boltzmann distribution & partition function.

Entropy as information measure.

Fluctuations & thermodynamic limit.

ðŸ“Œ Math needed: Probability, combinatorics, logarithms, some calculus of variations.

5. Classical Field Theory (gateway to QFT & GR)

Where mechanics + E&M generalize.

Lagrangian density for fields (Kleinâ€“Gordon, Maxwell).

Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations for fields.

Energy-momentum tensor.

Lorentz invariance in classical fields.
