### 1.1 Fermions vs. Bosons

**Fermions**
* Spin: half-integer (½, 3/2, …)
* Follow Fermi–Dirac statistics
* Obey Pauli Exclusion Principle (no two fermions in same state)
* Examples: electrons, quarks, neutrinos

Fun Fact:
Electrons are both fermions and leptons, as leptons are a subcategory of fundamental fermions. The two fundamental groups of particles in the Standard Model are bosons and fermions. Fermions are further divided into quarks and leptons. Electrons have an intrinsic spin of 1/2, which is a half-integer value, classifying them as fermions. As leptons, they do not experience the strong nuclear force and are considered fundamental particles.  
Why are electrons fermions?
Half-Integer Spin: Electrons have a spin of 1/2, which is characteristic of all fermions. 
Pauli Exclusion Principle: Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, meaning no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state at the same time. This principle is crucial for the structure of atoms and the periodic table. 
Fermi-Dirac Statistics: Electrons follow Fermi-Dirac statistics, a set of rules governing their behavior in quantum systems. 
Why are electrons leptons?
Elementary Particles: Leptons are fundamental particles, and the electron is the most well-known and abundant example. 
No Strong Interaction: Unlike quarks, leptons do not participate in the strong nuclear force. 
Components of Matter: Electrons are a primary component of matter and are found outside the nucleus of an atom. 

An electron cloud is the region around an atom's nucleus where electrons are most likely to be found, representing a probabilistic rather than a fixed path for electrons. This concept is part of the quantum mechanical atomic model and replaces the outdated idea of electrons orbiting like planets around a sun. The cloud's density varies, showing areas of higher and lower probability of finding an electron, and it helps explain the chemical behavior of atoms.  
Key characteristics:
Probability, not certainty: You cannot know an electron's exact location at any given time. The electron cloud model illustrates the statistical likelihood of finding an electron in different areas. 
Contrast with the Bohr model: The electron cloud model differs from the Bohr model, which depicted electrons in fixed, predictable circular orbits. 
Three-dimensional space: Electron clouds are generally spherical, though they may be shown as rings in two-dimensional diagrams. 
Role in chemistry: The shape and distribution of electron clouds influence an atom's chemical properties and its interactions with other atoms. 
How it works:
Rapid movement: Electrons move at extremely high speeds around the nucleus. 
Probability density: The cloud is more dense in regions where an electron is more likely to be found and less dense where it is less likely to be. 
Quantum mechanics: This model is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe the wave-like nature of electrons. 
Electron orbitals: The electron cloud is made up of various atomic orbitals (such as s, p, and d orbitals), which are specific regions of space where electrons are likely to be found with particular energy levels. 

An electron participates in the electromagnetic force and the weak force, but not the strong nuclear force or gravity. The electromagnetic force governs its interactions with charged particles, such as protons, holding atoms together and being responsible for electricity and chemical bonds. The weak force is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay, like beta decay, where an electron is emitted.  
Electromagnetic Force
Holds atoms together: The attractive electromagnetic force between the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged protons in the atomic nucleus keeps electrons bound to the atom. 
Responsible for electricity: The force that causes electrons to move directionally within a conductor is called electromotive force, or voltage, which is an aspect of the electromagnetic force. 
Mediates chemical reactions: The electromagnetic force plays a key role in chemical reactions and the formation of chemical bonds, as it dictates how electrons are shared or transferred between atoms. 
Weak Force 
Radioactive decay: Electrons are emitted during some types of radioactive decay, a process governed by the weak nuclear force.
Elementary particle interactions: Electrons are leptons, and their interaction with other particles can occur through the weak force.
Forces an electron does NOT participate in
Strong Nuclear Force: Electrons are too light and do not interact with the strong force, which binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. 
Gravity: While electrons possess mass and are subject to the force of gravity, it is so weak compared to the electromagnetic force that it is usually negligible in atomic and subatomic phenomena. 

Electromotive force (EMF) is the energy per unit charge supplied by a source, such as a battery or generator, to drive an electric current in a circuit. Despite its name, EMF is not a force but rather a voltage, or potential difference, that provides the energy for charge to move.

**Bosons**
* Spin: integer (0, 1, 2, …)
* Follow Bose–Einstein statistics
* Can occupy the same state (basis of lasers, Bose–Einstein condensates)
* Examples: photon, gluon, W/Z bosons, Higgs boson

Spin 0: Higgs boson
Spin 1: Photons, gluons, W and Z bosons
Spin 2: Hypothetical graviton

### Gluons

A gluon is a massless elementary particle that acts as the force carrier for the strong nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. They bind quarks together to form composite particles called hadrons, including protons and neutrons. 

**Properties and behavior**
**Massless and high-energy:** Gluons, like photons, have no mass and **travel at the speed of light.** However, the strong force they mediate is far more powerful than the electromagnetic force.
**Color charge:** While photons carry electric charge, **gluons carry a "strong charge" called color.** Quarks have three types of color charge **(red, green, or blue),** while gluons carry a **color and an anti-color charge.** The exchange of gluons between quarks is what changes a quark's color.
**Interaction with each other:** Unlike electrically neutral photons, gluons carry color charge, which means **they can interact directly with other gluons.** This self-interaction is a key feature of the strong force and is different from the electromagnetic force, where photons do not interact with each other.
**Eight types:** The theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts the existence of eight different types of gluons, which arise from the eight possible combinations of color and anti-color charges. 
**Quantum chromodynamics (QCD)**
Quantum chromodynamics is the theoretical framework that **describes the strong force and the behavior of quarks and gluons. It is a foundational component of the Standard Model of particle physics.** 
**Key phenomena of QCD include:**
**Color confinement:** No single quark or gluon has ever been observed in isolation. The intense strength of the color force as quarks are pulled apart prevents them from being separated. If enough energy is added, new quark-antiquark pairs are instead created from the energy.
**Asymptotic freedom:** The strong force gets weaker at very short distances (or high energies), allowing quarks to behave almost like free particles inside a proton or neutron. This is the opposite behavior of the electromagnetic force.
Here's why this happens:
Gluons and Color Charge: The strong force is mediated by gluons, which carry the "color charge" that binds quarks. 
Gluons Create More Gluons: Unlike photons in electromagnetism, gluons themselves carry color charge and can create other gluons. 
Flux Tubes: When quarks are pulled apart, the energy from their motion is used to create new gluons and form "flux tubes" of color field energy between them. 
Energy to New Quarks: As these flux tubes grow longer, they store more energy, eventually creating new quark-antiquark pairs. This process converts the added energy into new matter, rather than allowing the initial quark to escape. 
The Result: Confinement: 
The continuous creation of new quark-antiquark pairs ensures that isolated quarks are never observed in nature; they are always confined within hadrons.
This is why, when quarks are near, the force is weak, but when separated, the force gets stronger, and the process of pulling them apart creates new particles.
**Quark-gluon plasma:** Under extremely high temperatures and densities, like those found in particle accelerator collisions, protons and neutrons can "melt," and the quarks and gluons become deconfined. This creates a state of matter known as a quark-gluon plasma. 
**Role in the atom**
Gluons play a crucial role in forming the atomic nucleus:
They bind quarks together to form protons (two up quarks, one down quark) and neutrons (one up quark, two down quarks).
Though gluons do not directly bind protons and neutrons together, the strong force interactions within individual protons and neutrons create a powerful residual strong force that acts between them, overcoming the electromagnetic repulsion between the positively charged protons. 

### Flux Tubes
In the Standard Model of particle physics, the strong nuclear force that binds quarks together is modeled as thin flux tubes. 
Color confinement: The flux tube model provides an explanation for why individual quarks are never observed in experiments. As quarks are pulled apart, the energy stored in the flux tube increases. When enough energy is stored, it becomes favorable to create a new quark-antiquark pair, rather than to break the tube. This results in the formation of new particles instead of isolating the original quark. 

The process of color confinement 
The stretching flux tube: When two quarks inside a hadron are pulled apart, the gluon field between them stretches into a flux tube. Unlike other forces that weaken with distance, the strong force mediated by this flux tube actually gets stronger.
Energy increase: The energy stored in the flux tube increases linearly with distance. This is similar to stretching a rubber band.The "snap": At a certain point, the stored energy in the flux tube becomes so large that it is energetically cheaper to create new particles from that energy, according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (\(E=mc^{2}\)).Creation of new quark-antiquark pair: The flux tube "snaps," and a new quark and its corresponding antiquark are pulled out of the vacuum of space. The new quark combines with one of the original quarks, and the new antiquark combines with the other original quark.Formation of new hadrons: The newly formed particles quickly bind together to form color-neutral hadrons, such as mesons (quark-antiquark pairs). This effectively neutralizes the color charge and resolves the high-energy state of the stretched flux tube, preventing any free quarks from escaping. Why new gluons are not formed Gluons carry color charge: Unlike the photon of the electromagnetic force, gluons carry color charge and interact with other gluons. This self-interaction is the reason the flux tube forms in the first place.
Gluon confinement: Because gluons are not color-neutral, they cannot exist freely outside of a hadron, a concept also known as color confinement. Attempting to isolate a gluon would be subject to the same processes as trying to isolate a quark. The color force would confine any new gluons.
Pair production is the only viable release: As the flux tube is stretched, the energy must be released in a way that produces color-neutral particles. A quark-antiquark pair can combine to be color-neutral, making their creation the preferred outcome for dissipating the flux tube's energy. While exotic particles made solely of gluons, called "glueballs," are theorized, they are also color-neutral and would be formed within this same framework. However, the most common and lowest-energy process is the creation of a new quark-antiquark pair.

### Photons
A photon is classified as a boson because it has an integer spin of 1, which is a fundamental property defining bosons in quantum mechanics. As a type of boson called a gauge boson, the photon acts as the force-carrying particle for electromagnetism, mediating interactions between charged particles like electrons and protons, and is also considered the smallest discrete unit (or quantum) of light. Unlike fermions, which have half-integer spin and are governed by the Pauli exclusion principle, bosons like photons are not restricted and can occupy the same quantum state.  
**Why Photons are Bosons**
Integer Spin: The most important characteristic is their spin, which is an intrinsic angular momentum. All bosons have an integer spin (e.g., 0, 1, 2), while fermions (like electrons) have half-integer spin (e.g., 1/2, 3/2). 
Bose-Einstein Statistics: Bosons follow Bose-Einstein statistics, meaning multiple bosons can exist in the same quantum state simultaneously. This contrasts with fermions, which cannot. 
**Role of Photons as Bosons **
Force Carriers: Photons are gauge bosons, meaning they carry the electromagnetic force. When charged particles interact, they do so by exchanging photons.
Electromagnetism: This exchange of photons is responsible for all electromagnetic interactions, including the force that holds atoms together and the force that allows you to move objects.
Quantum Field Theory: In quantum field theory, photons are described as excitations of the electromagnetic field.
Key Characteristics
No Mass and Charge: Photons have no electric charge and zero rest mass, traveling at the speed of light in a vacuum. 
Particle and Wave: Photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, representing energy packets called quanta of light. 

A boson star is a hypothetical astronomical object composed of bosons, which are particles that can occupy the same quantum state. They differ fundamentally from conventional stars like our sun, which are primarily made of fermions such as protons and electrons. 

Composition and structure
Unlike ordinary matter that follows the Pauli exclusion principle, bosons can congregate in dense clouds, forming a giant Bose-Einstein condensate held together by its own gravity. The composition of a boson star depends on the type of boson involved: 
Scalar Bosons: Stars made of massive scalar bosons are described by the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations.
Vector Bosons: Composed of vector bosons with a spin of 1, these are known as Proca stars.
Dark Matter Candidates: A leading theory suggests that boson stars could be made of axions, a hypothetical particle that is also a candidate for dark matter.
Physical Appearance: Depending on their properties, boson stars are predicted to be either transparent or dark. Because of their immense gravity, they could resemble black holes to an outside observer by trapping light. Some models for spinning boson stars predict a toroidal, or donut-like, shape. 

Since boson stars can closely mimic black holes in many ways, distinguishing between them is difficult but a key goal in astrophysics. 

Fundamental differences
Event Horizon: Black holes have an event horizon, a point of no return from which nothing, not even light, can escape. Boson stars, in contrast, do not have an event horizon, allowing light and matter to pass through or be absorbed into the core.
Central Singularity: A black hole possesses a central singularity, a point of infinite density. A boson star, being a diffuse object, does not have a central singularity.
Composition and Stability: A black hole is described by a vacuum solution of Einstein's equations. A boson star, however, is a self-gravitating configuration of a complex scalar field, and its stability depends on various factors, including the mass of the constituent boson particle and its self-interaction. 
Observable differences (challenges)
Visual Appearance:
Black Hole: Appears as a central "shadow" surrounded by a bright, narrow photon ring, as famously imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).
Boson Star: Lacking an event horizon, a boson star's image may display multiple, concentric light rings and a central emission region. However, current EHT resolution may not be sufficient to reveal these subtle differences, making the boson star appear nearly identical to a black hole.
Accretion Dynamics:
Black Hole: Accreted matter and light disappear beyond the event horizon.
Boson Star: Accreted matter is not immediately absorbed. It can accumulate inside the star, possibly producing higher X-ray luminosity than would be expected from a black hole.
Gravitational Waves (GW):
Binary Mergers:
Black Holes: When two black holes merge, they produce a distinctive gravitational wave signal with a specific waveform.
Boson Stars: Merging boson stars can produce GW signals that, in some cases, appear statistically very similar to black hole mergers, making them difficult to distinguish using existing detection methods. Some studies have suggested that GW190521 might have been a boson star merger, not a black hole merger.
Tidal Effects: The GW signal from a coalescing binary is influenced by the tidal deformability of the objects. Boson stars have different tidal properties than black holes, and measuring this with high precision is a key goal for future gravitational wave detectors. 

A Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) is a unique state of matter formed when a gas of bosons is cooled to temperatures near absolute zero. At this extremely low temperature, the individual atoms lose their separate identities and collapse into a single, collective quantum state, behaving like a single "super-atom". 

BECs are extremely cold; in fact, they are a state of matter that exists near absolute zero (0 Kelvin or -273.15°C). This ultracold temperature is necessary to induce the phenomenon, where a gas of bosons collapses into a single quantum state, causing the particles to act as a single, unified entity.  

Macroscopic quantum coherence: When a large number of bosons are cooled to a low enough temperature, their individual quantum wavefunctions overlap and merge into a single macroscopic state. This collective, coherent behavior is a natural outcome of the rules of quantum mechanics. 

### W and Z Bosons
W+, W-, and Z⁰ (or Z0) bosons are the **force carriers for the weak nuclear force.** 
**W bosons (W+ and W-) mediate charged-current weak interactions, changing the type of quarks and leptons and altering electric charge.**
The **Z⁰ boson mediates neutral-current weak interactions, which do not change the electric charge of the interacting particles but transfer momentum and energy, like in neutrino scattering.** 

**Mediator: W+ and W- bosons.**
**Charge Transfer:** W bosons transfer **electric charge, altering the charge of the participating particles.**
**Flavor Change:** They are the only interactions that can change the flavor of quarks or leptons (e.g., a down quark changing into an up quark). 
**Examples:**
**Beta decay:** A **neutron transforms into a proton, emitting an electron and an electron antineutrino.**
**Neutrino interactions:** A **neutrino can be absorbed by a charged particle, creating a charged lepton of the same flavor.** 

**Z⁰ Boson**
**Neutral-Current Interactions:** The **Z⁰ boson is electrically neutral and does not change the electric charge of the interacting particles.**
**Momentum Transfer:** It **mediates weak interactions where particles exchange momentum, spin, and energy without changing their type.**
**Example:** A classic example is the scattering of a neutrino off an electron, a "neutral current interaction". 

**Gauge and scalar particles are distinct concepts:** 
a **gauge particle** is a **force-carrying boson (like the photon)** associated with a specific gauge symmetry, while a **scalar particle (like the Higgs boson)** is an **excitation of a scalar field and possesses zero spin,** making it fundamentally different from the **spin-1 gauge bosons** of the fundamental forces. Scalar fields also have intrinsic properties that differ from gauge fields, and scalar particles are not typically considered force carriers in the same way gauge particles are. 
**Gauge Particles (Gauge Bosons)**
**Role:** Gauge particles are fundamental force-mediating particles. 
**Associated Field:** They are **excitations of "gauge fields" which possess a gauge symmetry.** 
**Spin:** Gauge particles are **typically vector bosons with spin 1,** such as **photons (electromagnetism) and gluons (strong force).** The **hypothesized graviton** is also a gauge boson, but it would be a **spin-2 tensor boson.** 
**Examples:** **Photon, gluons, and the W and Z bosons** are examples of gauge particles. 

**Scalar Particles**
**Role:** Scalar particles are **excitations of scalar fields**, and the most well-known example is the **Higgs boson.** 
**Spin:** Scalar particles have **zero spin.** 
**Nature:** They are **not force-carrying in the same way that gauge bosons are.**
**Examples:** The Higgs boson is the **fundamental scalar particle known in physics.** 
**Key Differences**
**Spin:** The most fundamental difference is spin: **gauge bosons typically have spin 1 (or 2 for gravity)**, while **scalar particles have spin 0.** 
**Function:** **Gauge bosons are the primary mediators of fundamental forces,** while **scalar particles like the Higgs boson are responsible for giving mass to other particles.** 
**Field Type:** **Gauge particles are excitations of gauge fields**, whereas **scalar particles are excitations of scalar fields.**

### 1.5 Hadrons
* Baryons → 3 quarks (e.g., proton = uud, neutron = udd)
* Mesons → quark + antiquark (e.g., pion, kaon)

Hadrons are composite subatomic particles **made of two or more quarks held together by the strong nuclear force.** They are the building blocks of most visible matter in the universe, as **they include protons and neutrons found in atomic nuclei.** 

**Types of hadrons**
Hadrons are divided into two main categories based on their quark composition. 

**Baryons Composition:** **Composed of three quarks or three antiquarks.** This gives them an odd half-integer spin (like \(\frac{1}{2}\) or \(\frac{3}{2}\)) and classifies them as fermions.
**Key properties:** Baryons have a baryon number of **+1,** while their antimatter counterparts, antibaryons, have a baryon number of **-1.**
**Examples:** **Protons and neutrons** are the most common examples. **Exotic baryons called pentaquarks, composed of five quarks, have also been discovered.**

### Mesons

**Mesons Composition:** **Composed of a quark and an antiquark. This gives them an integer spin (0 or 1)** and classifies them as bosons.
**Key properties:** Mesons have a **baryon number of 0.** Unlike protons, **all mesons are unstable and decay quickly.**
**Examples: Pions and kaons are common examples produced in high-energy physics experiments.** **Exotic mesons like tetraquarks, made of four quarks,** are also being investigated.

**B mesons** are a **class of heavy, unstable subatomic particles composed of a bottom antiquark (\(\={b}\)) bound with a lighter quark.** Their unique properties make them valuable tools for studying the fundamental laws of physics, especially the weak force and the **Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix.**

Composition and types B mesons are a type of meson, a composite particle made of a quark and an antiquark. The specific composition determines the type of B meson: 
**Charged B meson** (\(B^{+}\)): Composed of an up quark (\(u\)) and a bottom antiquark (\(\={b}\)). Its antiparticle, the \(B^{-}\), consists of an anti-up quark (\(\={u}\)) and a bottom quark (\(b\)).Neutral B meson (\(B^{0}\)): Composed of a down quark (\(d\)) and a bottom antiquark (\(\={b}\)). Its antiparticle is \(\={B}^{0}\) (\(b\={d}\)).
**Strange B meson** (\(B_{s}^{0}\)): Consists of a strange quark (\(s\)) and a bottom antiquark (\(\={b}\)). Its antiparticle is \(\={B}_{s}^{0}\) (\(b\={s}\)).
**Charmed B meson** (\(B_{c}^{+}\)): Contains a charm quark (\(c\)) and a bottom antiquark (\(\={b}\)). Its antiparticle is $B_c^-$ (\(b\={c}\)). A combination of a bottom antiquark and a bottom quark forms bottomonium (\(\Upsilon \)), not a B meson. 

**Properties of hadrons** 
**Strong force interaction:** 
**Hadrons are defined by their ability to interact via the strong nuclear force, which holds their constituent quarks and gluons together.** This force is also responsible for binding protons and neutrons within an atomic nucleus.
**Zero net color charge:** Although quarks possess a property known as "color charge," **all hadrons are "colorless" (or white) in total.** The specific combinations of quarks **(three quarks of different colors for a baryon, or a quark-antiquark pair of corresponding colors for a meson)** must neutralize the overall color charge.
**Mass composition:** Surprisingly, the **mass of a hadron comes primarily from the energy of the gluons that bind the quarks together, not from the mass of the quarks themselves.** For instance, the **mass of a proton is hundreds of times greater than the combined mass of its constituent quarks.** (most of a proton's mass comes from the energy binding its constituent particles together, not from the mass of the particles themselves.)

**Stability:** **Most hadrons are unstable and decay into other particles after a short time.** The **major exception is the free proton, which is considered stable.** **Neutrons are stable only when bound inside an atomic nucleus; a free neutron decays in about 15 minutes.** 

### Pion
**Pion Definition:** A pion **(or pi meson)** is a subatomic particle belonging to the **meson family.** It is **composed of a quark and an antiquark held together by the strong nuclear force.** Pions are the **lightest of all mesons** and play a crucial role in the atomic nucleus. 
**Key facts:** 
**Three types:** 
**There are three types of pions:** a **positively charged pion** (\(\pi ^{+}\)), a **negatively charged pion** ($\pi^-\(),and a **neutral pion**(\)\pi^0$).
**Mediate the strong force:** The **exchange of pions between protons and neutrons** is the **primary mechanism of the residual strong nuclear force, which binds the nucleus together and counteracts the electromagnetic repulsion between protons.**
**Decay:** **Charged pions typically decay into a muon and a muon neutrino. Neutral pions decay much faster (electromagnetically) into two photons.**
**Production:** Pions are **produced in high-energy collisions,** including those involving cosmic rays hitting the Earth's atmosphere. 

### Kaon 
**Definition:** 
**A kaon (or K meson)** is **a meson** that **contains a strange quark or antiquark.** Because of this constituent quark, **kaons are considered "strange" particles.** 
**Key facts:** 
**Four types:** There are **four types of kaons,** including **charged** (\(K^{+}\), $K^-$) and **neutral** (\(K^{0}\), \(\={K^{0}}\)) varieties, with the **neutral kaons exhibiting more complex behavior.**
**Strangeness:** **Kaons carry a quantum number called "strangeness,"** which is a **property of the strange quark.** While they are **produced via the strong interaction, their decay is governed by the weak interaction, where strangeness is not conserved.**
**CP violation:** The discovery of kaons was critical for establishing the Standard Model of particle physics. **Studies of neutral kaon decays led to the discovery of CP violation, a subtle asymmetry between matter and antimatter that is essential to explaining why the universe contains more matter than antimatter.**
**Production and decay:** Kaons are **produced in high-energy interactions. Charged kaons can decay into muons, neutrinos, or pions. Neutral kaons (both K-short(short lived kaons) and K-long(long lived kaons) varieties) decay mainly into pions.** 

### Antiquark
An antiquark is the **antimatter particle corresponding to a quark**, **possessing the same mass and spin but opposite quantum numbers, including electric charge and baryon number.** Antiquarks are **fundamental components of antimatter**, joining **quarks and gluons to form composite particles like antiprotons.** They interact with quarks through the strong force and can combine with quarks to form mesons, such as B mesons, or form antiquark-antiquark pairs.  

**Key Characteristics**
Antiparticle of a quark: **For every type of quark, there is a corresponding antiquark.** 
Opposite quantum numbers: **An antiquark has the same mass and spin as its corresponding quark but carries the opposite electric charge and baryon number.** 
Fundamental particles: 
### **Antiquarks are considered fundamental particles, meaning they are not made up of smaller components.** 
Component of antimatter: They are **essential constituents of antimatter particles.**

**How Antiquarks Form**
Pair creation: **During high-energy events, such as in particle collisions, a quark and an antiquark can be created out of the vacuum, a process known as pair creation.**
Interaction with the strong force: The strong nuclear force holds particles together, and **when these forces snap, it results in the creation of new quark-antiquark pairs.** 
**Role in Particle Physics**
Formation of antimatter particles: **Antiquarks combine with other antiparticles, such as antigluons, to form antimatter composite particles, like antiprotons.**
Formation of mesons: **A quark and an antiquark can form a bound state(incredibly strong/only allows for color-neutral combinations) called a meson, like the J/ψ meson or B mesons, which are observed in laboratories.**
Understanding proton structure: **High-energy experiments, such as the SeaQuest experiment at Fermilab, study the distribution of antiquarks within protons to better understand the proton's internal structure.**

---

### Tetraquarks
A tetraquark is an **exotic meson**, **a subatomic particle composed of four valence quarks.** A **valence quark is a fundamental particle that defines the quantum numbers of a hadron, such as a proton or neutron.** 
**Composition:** A tetraquark contains **two quarks and two antiquarks** (\(q\={q}q\={q}\)). Since it has an **even number of quarks**, it is **classified as a meson.**
**Structure:** Scientists are investigating whether tetraquarks are a **1) compact system of four tightly bound quarks** or a **2)"hadronic molecule" consisting of two two-quark mesons that are loosely bound together.**
Discovery: While predicted by the theory of the strong nuclear force (Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD), the first tetraquark candidates were not confirmed until the **21st century** by experiments at facilities like the LHC. 

### Pentaquarks
A pentaquark is an **exotic baryon**, **a subatomic particle made of five valence quarks.** 
Composition: A pentaquark is composed of **four quarks and one antiquark** (\(qqqq\={q}\)). Since it has an **odd number of quarks,** it is **classified as a baryon, similar to a proton or neutron.**
Structure: Like tetraquarks, **physicists are exploring whether pentaquarks are a 1) compact five-quark state or a 2) "hadronic molecule" consisting of a three-quark baryon and a two-quark meson.**
Discovery: After decades of failed searches, the **first confirmed pentaquarks were discovered by the LHCb collaboration at CERN in 2015.** 

### Gravitons
The graviton is a **hypothetical elementary particle that is theorized to be the force carrier for gravity,** in the same way that the photon is the force carrier for the electromagnetic force. A consistent quantum theory of gravity has not yet been developed, so the graviton's existence remains unproven. 
Definition:
A graviton is a **theoretical massless, electrically neutral elementary particle.**
It is a **boson with a spin of 2,** unlike the photon, which has a spin of 1. A spin of 2 is required because the **source of gravity in general relativity is the stress-energy tensor, a second-order tensor.**
The **search for gravitons is an attempt to unify general relativity (the theory of gravity for large objects) with quantum mechanics (the theory of small particles).** 

Example:
A pair of interacting electrons in a particle accelerator would exchange virtual photons to mediate the electromagnetic force. In a unified quantum theory of gravity, two massive objects, such as planets, would interact by exchanging virtual gravitons.
Observations of gravitational waves, like those detected by LIGO, are providing information about the properties of the theorized graviton. For instance, the fact that **gravitational waves are observed to travel at the speed of light suggests that the graviton, if it exists, is massless.**

### Gauge Groups
**U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) are Lie groups**, a **type of mathematical symmetry group used in particle physics.** They are the **gauge groups of the Standard Model**, with each one describing a specific **fundamental force through a corresponding symmetry**. **According to Noether's theorem, for every continuous symmetry of a physical system, there is a corresponding conserved quantity.**

**U(1)**
Definition: The **unitary group of degree 1, denoted U(1), is the simplest Lie group.** It is the **group of all complex numbers with an absolute value of 1.** These numbers can be written as \(e^{i\theta }\), where \(\theta \) is a real number.The **U(1) group is abelian, meaning the order in which two transformations are applied does not matter (the multiplication is commutative).**
A **physical system with a U(1) symmetry is one whose physical properties do not change under a phase shift of its wavefunction.** 
Example: 
**Electromagnetism:** U(1) is the **gauge group of quantum electrodynamics (QED), the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force.**
**Conservation of electric charge:** The **U(1) symmetry in QED leads to the conservation of electric charge. Changing the phase of an electron's wavefunction does not alter its measurable properties, and this symmetry results in the conservation of charge.**
**Photon:** The **gauge boson (force-carrying particle) associated with the U(1) symmetry is the photon.** 

**SU(2)**
Definition:
The **special unitary group of degree 2, denoted SU(2), is the group of all 2x2 unitary matrices with a determinant of 1.**
Unlike U(1), **SU(2) is a non-abelian group, which means the order of operations matters (the multiplication is non-commutative).**
It **has three independent degrees of freedom, which correspond to the three gauge bosons of the weak interaction.**
Example:
**Weak Nuclear Force:** **SU(2) is the gauge group of the weak interaction.** It **describes how particles with a specific property called "weak isospin" transform into one another.**
**Beta decay:** **During a type of radioactive decay known as beta decay, an up quark in a proton changes into a down quark, converting the proton into a neutron. This transformation is mediated by a W boson and is an example of an SU(2) symmetry operation.**
**W and Z bosons:** The **three gauge bosons associated with the SU(2) symmetry are the W+, W-, and Z bosons.** 

**SU(3)**
Definition:
The **special unitary group of degree 3, denoted SU(3), is the group of all 3x3 unitary matrices with a determinant of 1.**
Like SU(2), it is a **non-abelian group. It has eight independent degrees of freedom.**
This **group is fundamental to the theory of the strong nuclear force, where it describes the transformations between the "color" charges of quarks.**
Example:
**Strong Nuclear Force:** **SU(3) is the gauge group of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction.** Quarks come in **three types** of **"color" charge—red, green, and blue**—and **SU(3) describes how these colors can transform into one another.**
**Color conservation:** The SU(3) symmetry results in the **conservation of color charge, ensuring that composite particles like protons and neutrons are "colorless".**
**Gluons:** The **eight gauge bosons associated with the SU(3) symmetry are the gluons. Each gluon carries a color-anticolor combination, allowing it to mediate the strong force between quarks**.

### Quarkonium, Charmonium, and Bottonium

Quarkonium is the **general term for any flavorless meson** consisting of a **heavy quark and its own antiquark.** **Charmonium and bottomonium are the most prominent examples of quarkonium, made of charm** (\(c\={c}\)) and **bottom** (\(b\={b}\)) **quarks,** respectively. These systems are crucial for studying the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks together. 

**Quarkonium** 
Definition: A meson containing a heavy quark and its corresponding antiquark. Since the quark and antiquark have opposite flavors, the meson is flavorless. **The name is an analogy to positronium, a bound state of an electron and a positron.**
Bound state analogy: **Heavy quarkonia systems are similar to the hydrogen atom, but bound by the strong force mediated by gluons rather than the electromagnetic force.** The **different energy levels and states of quarkonium particles are described by non-relativistic quantum mechanics, an effective theory called non-relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD).**
**Top quarks:** The **top quark is so massive that it decays via the weak interaction before a bound state can form, so toponium (\(t\={t}\)) has not been observed.**
**Lighter quarks:** **Quarks lighter than charm (up, down, and strange) have similar masses and move at relativistic speeds, so their bound states cannot be described as simple quarkonia.** 

**Charnomium (\(c\={c}\))**
Constituents: A charmed quark and its antiquark.Discovery: The first charmonium state, the J/\(\psi \) particle, was discovered in 1974. This discovery was a pivotal moment in particle physics, providing early confirmation of the quark model.Mass: The charm quark is significantly heavier than light quarks, but lighter than the bottom quark. The mass of charmonium is approximately 3.1 GeV/\(c^{2}\).Velocity: The quarks in charmonium are estimated to move at a velocity of roughly 0.3 times the speed of light, making them semi-non-relativistic.Properties:Energy levels: Charmonium exhibits a spectrum of energy levels similar to those of an atom.Binding energy: Since the charm quarks are lighter than bottom quarks, charmonium states are more loosely bound than bottomonium states.Dissociation: Loosely bound charmonium states "melt" at lower temperatures in a quark-gluon plasma than more strongly bound states. This is used as a tool to measure the temperature of the medium in heavy-ion collisions.

**Bottomonium (\(b\={b}\))**

Constituents: A bottom (or beauty) quark and its antiquark.
Discovery: The **first bottomonium state, the \(\Upsilon \) (upsilon) meson, was discovered in 1977.**
Mass: The bottom quark is **heavier than the charm quark**, making **bottomonium states heavier than charmonium states.** The mass of the \(\Upsilon (1S)\) is **approximately 9.5 GeV/\(c^{2}\).**
Velocity: The quarks in bottomonium move at a **slower, more non-relativistic velocity of approximately 0.1 times the speed of light.**
Properties:Binding energy: Due to their greater mass, bottom quarks **form more tightly bound states than charm quarks.**
Dissociation: Because they are more tightly bound, **bottomonium states melt at higher temperatures in a quark-gluon plasma compared to charmonium states.**
Probe for QGP: Bottomonium states are considered a good probe for studying the hot and dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions.

### Born Rule
The Born Rule is a **foundational principle of quantum mechanics**, first formulated by **Max Born**, that **connects a quantum system's mathematical wave function (Ψ) to the actual probabilities of measurement outcomes.** It states that the **probability of measuring a specific outcome is equal to the absolute value squared of the corresponding part of the wave function, or P = |Ψ|².** This rule establishes that **quantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic, providing a way to translate the abstract wave function into real-world, measurable probabilities, as demonstrated in experiments and vital for understanding phenomena like superposition and entanglement.**  

**Key Aspects of the Born Rule**
Probabilistic Nature: In contrast to classical physics, where a system's state can be known with certainty, **quantum mechanics is probabilistic, and the Born Rule quantifies these probabilities.** 
Wave Function: **The wave function (Ψ) describes the quantum state of a system, but it is an abstract mathematical construct.**
Measurement: **When a measurement is performed on a quantum system, its wave function "collapses" into a definite state, and the Born Rule tells us the probability of finding a particular result.**
Experimental Verification: The Born Rule is **not just a theoretical concept; it has been experimentally verified through various quantum experiments, providing a framework for predicting measurement outcomes.** 
Example: **Finding a Particle**
A common application is **determining the probability of finding a particle at a specific position.** 
If the wave function describes the particle's state, **the probability density for finding the particle at a given position is proportional to the square of the wave function's amplitude at that position.**
**Significance**
Bridge to Reality: The **Born Rule bridges the gap between the abstract mathematical description of a quantum system and the concrete, observable outcomes of measurements in the real world.** 
Foundation of Quantum Mechanics: It is a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics, crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of quantum systems and their interactions.

**Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation**
Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are three forms of ionizing radiation emitted by unstable, radioactive atomic nuclei. They have distinct properties regarding their composition, mass, charge, penetrating power, and biological effects. 

The health risk from these types of radiation depends on whether the source is external (outside the body) or internal (inside the body). 
Alpha radiation:
External exposure: Poses little threat externally since the dead layers of skin can block it.
Internal exposure: Poses a serious health threat if inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed into the bloodstream. Inside the body, it can cause severe damage to sensitive living tissue due to its high ionizing power.
Beta radiation:
External exposure: Can cause skin burns, but the particles do not travel far and are less damaging than gamma rays.
Internal exposure: Most hazardous when ingested, as the particles can cause damage to internal tissues.
Gamma radiation:
External exposure: Poses the greatest external hazard because it can penetrate deeply into the body, damaging tissues and DNA throughout.
Internal exposure: Less of a contamination risk than alpha or beta because most of it will pass straight through the body, but some energy is still absorbed by tissues. 
Sources and uses
Alpha radiation:
Sources: Produced by the radioactive decay of heavy elements like uranium, radium, and polonium. Radon gas is a natural source of alpha particles.
Uses: Used in smoke detectors, where the alpha particles ionize the air to create a small current. Smoke disrupts the current and sets off the alarm.
Beta radiation:
Sources: Emitted by unstable atoms with an excess of neutrons, such as carbon-14, strontium-90, and tritium.
Uses: Used in medical radiotherapy to treat superficial tumors. It is also used in industrial gauges to measure the thickness of materials like paper.
Gamma radiation:
Sources: Released from an excited nucleus following alpha or beta decay to shed excess energy. Medical x-rays are also a type of electromagnetic radiation, though typically with less energy than gamma rays.
Uses: Used in medicine for sterilization of equipment, cancer treatment (radiotherapy), and medical imaging. 

### Hilbert Space
the mathematics of quantum states lives in Hilbert space, which is essentially a vector space (with inner products, orthogonality, linear combinations, etc.). Fermions and bosons just have different transformation properties in that vector space under exchange operations.
* Higgs boson: scalar, not a gauge boson
* Muons vs. Electrons: muons are heavier (~200x)
* Antiparticles: same mass, opposite charge & quantum numbers

  Self-gravity is the gravitational force a celestial object or system exerts on itself, causing its own matter to attract and hold together. This force is essential for maintaining the structure of massive bodies like stars, planets, and galaxies, which would otherwise dissipate. While significant for large celestial bodies, self-gravity is negligible for small objects like a human, which are held together by stronger chemical bonds. 
How Self-Gravity Works 
Mutual Attraction: A large, non-uniform object, such as a star or a disk of gas and dust, has many individual components. Self-gravity is the effect of each part of the object pulling on every other part.
Holding It Together: This collective gravitational pull acts to keep the object's material from drifting apart.
Comparison to Other Forces: For large enough masses and sizes, gravity becomes the dominant force holding the object together. For smaller, less dense objects, chemical bonds or other forces are stronger and hold the object's parts together.
Examples of Self-Gravity in Action
Planets and Stars: The self-gravity of Earth keeps the planet intact, while the same principle allows our sun to maintain its spherical shape. 
Galaxies and Clusters: Self-gravity is also responsible for holding together stars within galaxies and galaxies within clusters, preventing them from dispersing. 
Accretion and Star Formation: In the process of star formation, self-gravity causes dense clouds of gas and dust to collapse, pulling material together to form stars. It also plays a role in the growth of planetesimals and protoplanets in protoplanetary disks. 
Importance in Astrophysics
Defining Objects: Self-gravity helps define objects in a physically meaningful way, distinguishing truly gravitational bodies from those held together by other forces. 
Modeling Cosmic Structures: It is a crucial factor in astrophysical models, affecting the dynamics and evolution of celestial bodies and large-scale structures in the universe.

star clusters are held together by the mutual gravitational attraction of their stars, which originate from the same gas cloud and are bound by their shared gravity to form a coherent group. This gravitational pull keeps the stars from drifting apart and holds them in a system, influencing their density, shape, and long-term stability.  
How gravity binds stars in a cluster
Common Origin: Stars in a cluster form from the same giant cloud of gas and dust, which allows their collective gravity to hold them together. 
Gravitational Well: Once the stars are born, their individual gravitational forces combine, creating a gravitational well that keeps them in a system. 
Stability: The self-gravity of the cluster creates a binding force that can hold the stars together for billions of years, though over long periods, factors like interactions with other stars and galactic tides can cause them to disperse. 
Why gravity doesn't cause immediate collapse
While gravity is the binding force, stars within a cluster are also in constant motion. They orbit the cluster's center of mass, and the outward pressure from their own internal processes helps to balance the inward pull of gravity. 
A cluster's size, density, and the internal motions of its stars all play a role in its overall stability. 
In essence, a star cluster is a gravitationally bound system where the stars attract each other, preventing them from being scattered throughout the galaxy. 

Gravitational Well
A gravitational well is a conceptual model that describes the gravitational field surrounding a massive object in space. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity is not a force but a curvature of spacetime caused by mass. The gravitational well visualizes this distortion, with the well's "depth" corresponding to the object's mass. 

How the gravitational well model works
The rubber sheet analogy: A simple way to understand a gravitational well is to imagine a taut rubber sheet representing spacetime.
Mass creates a dent: When a heavy object, like a planet, is placed on the sheet, it creates a depression or "well". The more massive the object, the deeper the well it creates.
Gravity's pull: A smaller object, like a marble, rolled nearby will appear to be pulled toward the larger object, following the curve in the sheet.
Orbiting motion: If the marble has enough speed, it will enter an orbit around the central mass, like a satellite around a planet.
Escaping the well: To escape the well, an object must travel fast enough to overcome the gravitational pull—this is known as escape velocity. 
Key concepts of gravitational wells
Gravitational potential energy: An object's position in a gravitational well determines its gravitational potential energy. The further away an object is from the center of the mass, the more potential energy it has.
Energy and motion: The laws of energy conservation explain the motion of objects within a gravitational well. As an object moves deeper into the well, it loses potential energy but gains kinetic energy (speed).
Escape velocity: To "climb out" of a gravity well, an object requires a large amount of energy to achieve escape velocity. The deeper the well, the more energy is needed.
Gravitational lensing: The concept of the gravity well also helps explain gravitational lensing, where a massive object's gravitational field bends the path of light from a more distant source. 
Examples of gravitational wells
The Sun: As the most massive object in our solar system, the Sun has the deepest gravity well, holding all the planets in orbit.
Earth: Compared to the Sun, Earth has a shallower gravity well, but it is deep enough to hold the moon in orbit and keep satellites from escaping into space.
Asteroids and moons: These celestial bodies have very shallow gravity wells because of their smaller mass.
Black holes: These are objects with extremely dense mass that produce the deepest possible gravitational wells. The gravity well of a black hole is so deep that not even light can escape once it crosses the event horizon. 


nature often favors spherical shapes because a sphere is the most compact and stable form, requiring the least surface area for a given volume and being the most symmetric shape. Forces like gravity, self-gravity, and surface tension pull matter equally in all directions, naturally leading to the formation of spheres in objects such as planets, stars, water droplets, and even cells. 
Why Spheres are Common in Nature
Minimizing Surface Area: A sphere encloses the largest volume with the smallest possible surface area. 
Gravity: For large, massive objects like planets and stars, gravity pulls matter towards the center, creating a spherical shape to become the most stable configuration. 
Surface Tension: For small objects like water droplets and bubbles, surface tension acts like a force pulling the surface inward, creating a sphere to minimize energy and surface area. 
Symmetry: A sphere is perfectly symmetric, with no axis that, when rotated, leaves the object unchanged. 
Examples of Spheres in Nature
Cosmic Scale: Planets, stars, and even the entire observable universe are often spherical. 
Terrestrial Scale: Bubbles, water droplets, and even some cells adopt a spherical shape due to surface tension. 
Molecular Scale: Atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter, have a spherical nature. 
Not All Objects are Perfect Spheres
While spheres are common, other factors can distort them: 
Rotation: Rapid rotation can flatten an object at its poles and expand it at its equator, creating an oblate spheroid shape, as seen in planets like Earth and Jupiter. 
Deformations: Things like weathered rocks can be deformed into non-spherical shapes, though some might eventually become spherical over time. 

humans are made of "stardust" because the majority of the elements in our bodies, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron, were forged in the cores of ancient stars through nuclear fusion and then dispersed into the cosmos by stellar explosions like supernovas. These stellar remnants then formed new generations of stars and planets, including Earth, providing the raw materials necessary for life to develop.  
How elements were made in stars
Big Bang: The universe's first moments produced only the lightest elements: hydrogen and helium. 
Star formation: As the universe cooled, gravity pulled these elements together to form the first stars, which act as cosmic furnaces. 
Nuclear fusion: Inside a star's core, intense heat and pressure cause hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium, and then heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. 
Stellar deaths: When stars run out of fuel, they collapse and explode as supernovas. This process scatters the newly created elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and iron, throughout space. 
Cosmic recycling: These stellar remnants enrich interstellar clouds, which then collapse to form new stars and planets, making the elements available for new systems, including our own solar system and Earth. 
Why we are stardust
Common elements: The fundamental elements of the human body—like the carbon in our DNA, the oxygen we breathe, and the calcium in our bones—were all created inside stars. 
Cosmic origin: These elements were dispersed by ancient stars before Earth or humanity existed. 
Shared heritage: This shared atomic heritage connects all living things on Earth to the vast universe, embodying the idea expressed by astronomer Carl Sagan that we are all made of "star stuff". 

humans are made of fermions. The most fundamental particles that make up matter in the universe, including humans, are fermions, specifically quarks and leptons like electrons and neutrinos. These elementary fermions combine to form composite fermions, such as protons and neutrons, which in turn build the atoms that make up all physical matter, including your body.  
What are fermions?
Matter particles: Fermions are the elementary particles that constitute matter. 
Spin 1/2 particles: They are characterized by their half-integer spin, which is a quantum mechanical property. 
Obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle: Fermions follow the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This principle is crucial for the structure of matter, as it prevents atoms from collapsing and forces electrons to arrange themselves in shells. 
How do fermions make up humans?
Elementary Fermions: The smallest constituents of matter are elementary particles, which include quarks and leptons. 
Composite Fermions:
Quarks are fundamental fermions that combine to form composite fermions, namely protons and neutrons. 
Electrons are another type of fundamental fermion. 
Atoms and Molecules: Protons and neutrons form the nuclei of atoms, while electrons orbit the nucleus. The combination of these particles forms atoms, which are the building blocks of all matter. 
Human Body: Your body is composed of a vast number of atoms, primarily of elements like hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. These atoms are made up of the fundamental fermionic particles (protons, neutrons, and electrons). 

Dark matter halos are the invisible, vast, and roughly spherical regions of dark matter that surround galaxies. They provide the gravitational scaffolding upon which galaxies are built and are essential to explaining galaxy dynamics and the large-scale structure of the universe. 

What they are
Composed of dark matter: These halos are made of dark matter, a substance that accounts for about 85% of the universe's mass. Dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, so it cannot be directly observed.
Size and shape: A dark matter halo extends far beyond the visible edges of a galaxy, and the density of the dark matter decreases with distance from the galactic center. The shape of halos is often described as ellipsoidal rather than perfectly spherical.
Ubiquitous scaffolding: According to the standard cosmological model, every galaxy, group, and cluster of galaxies is embedded within its own dark matter halo. 
Evidence for their existence
Since dark matter halos are invisible, their existence is inferred indirectly through their gravitational effects on the visible matter and light around them. 
Galaxy rotation curves: This is one of the strongest pieces of evidence. Observations show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies orbit at unexpectedly high speeds. Without a massive, invisible halo of dark matter, the galaxy's visible mass would not be enough to hold the fast-moving outer regions in orbit, and the galaxy would fly apart.
Gravitational lensing: The massive gravity of dark matter halos bends light from distant objects, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. By analyzing the distorted images of background galaxies, scientists can map the distribution of mass—including dark matter—in the foreground cluster. The Bullet Cluster provides a particularly striking example, where the mass distribution is clearly separate from the hot gas, strongly implying the existence of dark matter.
Galaxy cluster dynamics: X-ray observations of hot gas in galaxy clusters show that the gas is too energetic to be contained by the visible matter's gravity alone. An enormous dark matter halo provides the extra gravitational pull needed to keep the cluster from dispersing. 
Formation and evolution
Dark matter halos form through a hierarchical process of gravitational collapse, according to modern cosmological models like the Lambda-CDM model. 
Early universe: Small quantum fluctuations in matter density in the early universe acted as seeds for gravitational collapse.
Growth and collapse: Because dark matter has no pressure, these slightly overdense regions grew by attracting more matter via gravity. When a region reached a critical density, it stopped expanding with the universe and collapsed under its own gravity to form a dark matter halo.
Hierarchical merging: Halos grew in mass and size by accreting surrounding dark matter and merging with other, smaller halos. This process created a "cosmic web" of halos, filaments, and voids.
Subhalos: Smaller halos that are gravitationally captured by a larger halo are called subhalos. They continue to orbit within their host halo and can experience tidal forces and dynamical friction that strip away their mass. 
Role in galaxy formation
Dark matter halos are the primary architects of galaxy formation.
Gravitational wells: The gravitational wells of dark matter halos pull in baryonic (ordinary) matter like gas and dust. This gas loses energy and angular momentum through collisions, allowing it to sink to the center of the halo and form a flattened, rotating disk.
Star formation: The increasing gas density at the center of the halo eventually allows for the formation of stars, which aggregate into a galaxy.
Influence on galactic properties: The mass, shape, and merger history of a dark matter halo significantly influence the resulting galaxy's properties, such as its star formation rate, gas distribution, and morphology. 
Puzzles and ongoing research
Starless halos: Some small dark matter halos may never have accumulated enough gas to form stars and could exist as completely dark, invisible objects. Detecting these could provide a new window for studying dark matter.
The "cuspy halo problem": Early simulations of dark matter halos predicted a very high-density "cusp" at their center, which does not always match observational data from galaxies. This has led to explorations of alternative dark matter models, such as self-interacting dark matter, which could result in a smoother core.
Understanding halo edges: The study of a halo's outer boundary, or "splashback radius," can provide insights into how halos grow and test our models of gravity. 

### Hilbert Space

A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space that generalizes the concept of Euclidean space to include infinite dimensions. Equipped with an inner product, it allows for the measurement of length and angle and contains no "gaps," meaning that any sequence of vectors that is headed toward a limit will converge to an element that is already in the space. This completeness makes it suitable for advanced calculus and analysis. 

Named after the mathematician David Hilbert, the concept was formalized in the early 20th century by John von Neumann, who recognized its foundational importance for quantum mechanics.

Key properties
A vector space must satisfy several conditions to be considered a Hilbert space: Vector Space: It must allow for vector addition and scalar multiplication.Inner Product: It must possess an inner product, a function that takes two vectors and produces a scalar, which can be used to define length and angle. The inner product has three properties:Conjugate Symmetry: \(\langle u,v\rangle =\overline{\langle v,u\rangle }\), where the bar denotes the complex conjugate.Linearity: \(\langle au+bv,w\rangle =a\langle u,w\rangle +b\langle v,w\rangle \).Positive Definiteness: \(\langle v,v\rangle \ge 0\), with equality only if \(v\) is the zero vector.Completeness: The space must be complete, meaning that every Cauchy sequence (a sequence where the terms get arbitrarily close to each other) must converge to a limit within the space. Examples Euclidean space (\(R^{n}\)): Any finite-dimensional vector space with a dot product is a Hilbert space. The standard Euclidean space is a familiar example.Sequence spaces (\(\ell ^{2}\)): This is the space of all infinite sequences of complex numbers \((z_{1},z_{2},z_{3},\dots )\) such that the sum of the squares of their magnitudes is finite: \(\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }|z_{n}|^{2}<\infty \).Lebesgue spaces (\(L^{2}\)): This space consists of complex-valued functions for which the integral of the squared magnitude is finite: \(\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }|f(x)|^{2}dx<\infty \). In quantum mechanics, wave functions are elements of \(L^{2}\). Applications Quantum Mechanics: The most famous application of Hilbert spaces is as the mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. In this context:The possible states of a quantum system are represented by vectors, known as "state vectors," within a Hilbert space.Physical quantities that can be measured (observables) are represented by operators that act on these state vectors.The inner product of two state vectors is a "probability amplitude," whose squared absolute value gives the probability of a system transitioning from one state to another.Functional Analysis: Hilbert spaces serve as a central object of study in functional analysis, a branch of mathematics concerned with vector spaces of functions.Fourier Analysis and Signal Processing: Hilbert spaces provide the setting for Fourier series and Fourier transforms, which are used to analyze and process signals and images.Differential Equations: They are used to formulate and find solutions to partial differential equations, especially with techniques such as the Galerkin method.Machine Learning: The theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) is used in machine learning algorithms, particularly in support vector machines (SVMs).
