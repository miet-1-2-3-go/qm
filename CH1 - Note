Fermi energy (EF) is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, defining the energy of the highest occupied single-particle quantum state in a system of non-interacting fermions at absolute zero temperature (0 Kelvin). This energy level, also known as the Fermi level at absolute zero, acts as a boundary separating filled from unoccupied energy states and is a crucial property for understanding the behavior of electrons in solids and other materials. 
Key Aspects of Fermi Energy
Absolute Zero: The Fermi energy is specifically defined at absolute zero (0 K), where electrons fill the lowest available energy states. 
Fermions: This concept applies to systems composed of fermions, particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. 
Fermi Level: At temperatures above absolute zero, the Fermi energy is generalized to the Fermi level, which represents the energy at which the probability of occupation is 50%. 
Chemical Potential: The Fermi level is also often referred to as the chemical potential of the system. 
Significance: Fermi energy helps explain various material properties, including electrical conductivity in metals, the behavior of electrons in semiconductors, and even the stability of matter at extreme conditions.
