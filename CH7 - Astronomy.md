## 1.1 Doppler Effect

The Doppler effect is the perceived change in the frequency of a wave due to the relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. This phenomenon applies to all types of waves, including sound, light, and water waves. The shifts in light waves are known as redshift and blueshift. 

### Redshift: When a source moves away

A redshift occurs when a light-emitting object moves away from an observer. This movement stretches the light waves, increasing their wavelength and decreasing their frequency.
The light shifts towards the longer wavelength, or "red," end of the visible spectrum.
 
**Examples of redshift**
* The expanding universe: Edwin Hubble's observations showed that the light from most distant galaxies is redshifted, and the farther away a galaxy is, the greater its redshift. This led to the discovery that the universe is expanding.
* A rotating galaxy: When astronomers observe a spiral galaxy, the side spinning away from Earth will show a slight redshift. Meanwhile, the side spinning toward Earth will be blueshifted.
* Exoplanet detection: As a star wobbles back and forth due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet, the light from the star will periodically shift between red and blue. 


### Blueshift: When a source moves closer

A blueshift occurs when a light-emitting object moves towards an observer. This compresses the light waves, which shortens their wavelength and increases their frequency. 
The light shifts toward the shorter wavelength, or "blue," end of the visible spectrum.
 
**Examples of blueshift**
* Andromeda Galaxy: Though the universe is expanding, the Andromeda Galaxy is gravitationally bound to our own and is on a collision course with the Milky Way. Its light is therefore blueshifted.
* Binary star systems: As one star in a binary system moves toward Earth in its orbit, its light will be blueshifted. As it moves away, its light will be redshifted.
* Nearby star motion: Stars close enough to the Milky Way, such as Barnard's Star, can exhibit a small blueshift because their local motion towards Earth overcomes the overall expansion of the universe. 

**Everyday sound vs. light examples**
The Doppler effect is most apparent in everyday life with sound waves, but its principles are identical for light. 
* Sound: When an ambulance approaches, its siren sounds higher in pitch. As it passes and moves away, the pitch drops noticeably. This is because the sound waves are compressed as the ambulance moves toward you (higher frequency) and stretched as it moves away (lower frequency).
* Light: The shifts in light from celestial objects are typically too small and the speed too great for the human eye to detect any color change. Astronomical instruments like spectrometers are required to measure these subtle shifts.

## 1.2 Binary Star System
 
A binary star system consists of two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, also known as the barycenter. This gravitational pairing is very common; over half of all star systems in the Milky Way are believed to be binary or multiple-star systems.  

**How the system works**
* Center of mass: The two stars in a binary system orbit around a single point, the center of mass.
If the stars have similar mass, the center of mass is located roughly halfway between them, and they will trace similar-sized orbits.
If one star is significantly more massive than the other, the center of mass is closer to the heavier star. The more massive star's orbit will be smaller and tighter, while the lighter star's orbit will be larger. A classic example is the Sirius system, where the dim white dwarf (Sirius B) orbits the bright main-sequence star (Sirius A).

**Distance determines interaction:** Binary systems are often categorized as either "wide" or "close" binaries based on their separation.

* 1. Wide binaries: The stars are far enough apart that they do not significantly affect each other's evolution.
* 2. Close binaries: The stars are so close that their gravitational pulls can affect each other's atmospheres, and one star may even transfer mass to the other. 

**Classifications by observation**
Because of the wide range of characteristics, binary stars are often categorized by how they are observed. 
* Visual binaries: The two stars are far enough apart that they can be resolved as separate objects using a telescope. Astronomers can directly observe the stars orbiting each other over many decades or centuries.
* Spectroscopic binaries: The stars are too close together to be seen separately, even with a powerful telescope. However, their binary nature is revealed through the Doppler effect in their light spectra. As one star moves toward Earth and the other moves away, their light is alternately blueshifted and redshifted.
* Eclipsing binaries: These systems are oriented in such a way that one star regularly passes in front of the other from our vantage point, causing a temporary dip in the system's total brightness. The light curve, a graph of brightness over time, reveals their orbital period and relative sizes.
* Astrometric binaries: These systems involve a visible star that is gravitationally "tugging" on an unseen companion. Astronomers detect this unseen partner by observing the periodic "wobble" in the visible star's proper motion.
 
**Binary stars are crucial to astronomy for a number of reasons:**
* Measuring mass: Binary systems provide the best and most direct method for astronomers to determine the mass of distant stars. By observing their orbits, and applying Isaac Newton's version of Kepler's laws, astronomers can calculate the stars' masses.
* Understanding stellar evolution: Close binary systems with mass transfer provide opportunities to study stellar evolution in ways that are not possible with single stars.
* Creating cosmic phenomena: Many unusual and energetic phenomena, including Type Ia supernovae, novae, and X-ray binaries, originate in binary systems.

## 1.3 Commonly used Instruments in Astronomy


**Instruments for the electromagnetic spectrum**
* Radio Telescopes: These large antennas detect the longest wavelengths of light, revealing cold gas clouds, pulsars, and radio galaxies hidden behind cosmic dust.
* Infrared Telescopes: Optimized for detecting "heat," these instruments pierce through dust clouds to study stellar nurseries, exoplanets, and some of the most distant galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a prominent infrared example.
* Ultraviolet (UV) Telescopes: Observing from space, these telescopes study hot, high-energy objects like young stars and active galaxies, as Earth's atmosphere blocks most UV radiation.
* X-ray Telescopes: These instruments capture high-energy X-rays from violent cosmic events like black holes and supernova remnants. The Chandra X-ray Observatory is a well-known example.
* Gamma-ray Telescopes: Detecting the most energetic form of light, these instruments observe extreme phenomena like gamma-ray bursts, often from space to avoid atmospheric interference. 



* Gravitational Wave Detectors: These observatories, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), detect ripples in spacetime caused by cataclysmic events like colliding black holes and neutron stars.
* Neutrino Detectors: Buried deep underground or encased in ice (like the IceCube Neutrino Observatory), these instruments detect nearly massless, weakly interacting particles produced by nuclear processes in stars and other cosmic events.
* Cosmic Ray Observatories: These facilities, which can be ground-based (like the Pierre Auger Observatory) or space-based (like the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station), study high-energy particles that bombard Earth's atmosphere from deep space.
* Space Probes and Rovers: These robotic explorers are sent to specific celestial bodies (planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) to gather close-up, in-situ information about their composition, geology, and environments. 

**Image acquisition and enhancement tools**
* Interferometers: This technique links multiple telescopes, often spread across a wide area, to combine their signals. This creates a "virtual telescope" with a much larger effective aperture, resulting in extremely high-resolution images. The Event Horizon Telescope, which first imaged a black hole, is a powerful example.
* Adaptive Optics (AO): Used with ground-based telescopes, AO systems use computer-controlled deformable mirrors to correct for image-blurring atmospheric turbulence in real-time. This produces sharper images that rival the clarity of space telescopes.
* Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs): These highly sensitive digital cameras are used to capture astronomical images. They are far more efficient at converting photons into signal than traditional photographic plates, allowing for observations of much fainter and more distant objects.
* Spectrographs: These instruments split light into its component wavelengths (a spectrum), revealing details about an object's chemical composition, temperature, and motion through the Doppler effect. Spectrographs are designed for various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, not just visible light.

## 1.4 The H-R Diagram

The Hertzsprung–Russell (H-R) diagram is a scatter plot of stars that shows the relationship between a star's luminosity and its effective temperature. It is one of the most important tools in astrophysics, used to classify stars and explain their evolution. 

* Diagram axes and orientation Vertical axis (y-axis): Luminosity or absolute magnitude. This measures a star's intrinsic brightness. Luminosity is often measured in solar units $$(\(L_{\odot }\))$$, where the sun's luminosity is 1. Higher values are at the top, and lower values are at the bottom. Absolute magnitude is another scale for brightness, with lower (more negative) numbers representing brighter stars.
* Horizontal axis (x-axis): Temperature or spectral class. Surface temperature is measured in Kelvin, with hotter stars on the left and cooler stars on the right. This is opposite to most graphs.Spectral class is a classification system for stars based on temperature and color, running from hottest to coolest (O, B, A, F, G, K, M). This scale is also typically shown along the x-axis. Main stellar groups on the H-R diagram When plotted, stars are not randomly distributed but fall into distinct regions based on their stage of evolution. 
* Main Sequence: A diagonal band stretching from the hot, luminous upper-left to the cool, dim lower-right.Stars spend about 90% of their lives in this phase, fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores.Our Sun is a main-sequence star, located roughly in the middle of this band.A star's position on the main sequence is determined by its mass, with hotter, more massive stars at the upper-left and cooler, less massive ones at the lower-right.
* Red Giants and Supergiants: Found in the upper-right of the diagram.These stars are cool but very luminous because they have expanded to enormous sizes.They are in a later stage of evolution after exhausting the hydrogen in their cores.
* White Dwarfs: Located in the lower-left.These stars are very hot but have extremely low luminosity due to their small size, comparable to Earth.They are the final evolutionary stage for low-to-intermediate-mass stars. What the H-R diagram reveals By showing how luminosity and temperature are related, the H-R diagram is used for several key purposes in astronomy: 
Classification: It provides a systematic way to categorize stars.Stellar evolution: It charts the life cycle of a star. As a star ages, its properties change, and it moves to different regions of the diagram.Stellar properties: An individual star's location on the diagram indicates its temperature, luminosity, color, and size.Star clusters: Astronomers can plot H-R diagrams for star clusters to estimate their age. Older clusters have stars that have "turned off" the main sequence and moved toward the giant regions.
